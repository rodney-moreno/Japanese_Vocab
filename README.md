## Learn-Kanji
This is a web app built using pure nodejs to practice Kanji required for the JLPT!

**JLPT**, is a standardized  [criterion-referenced test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion-referenced_test)  to evaluate and certify  [Japanese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language)  proficiency for non-native speakers, covering language knowledge, reading ability, and listening ability.

The goal with this project was to create an app that used server side rendering, and used an API. To accomplish that I used [Hogan.js](https://github.com/twitter/hogan.js/) to create dynamic webpages. The API I used is [kanjiapi.dev](https://github.com/onlyskin/kanjiapi.dev).
